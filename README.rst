LivingLogic.Python.pycoco
-------------------------

pycoco is a script that can be used to generate code
coverage info for the Python source code.

The script downloads the Python source code, builds the interpreter
with code coverage options, runs the test suite and generates an HTML
report how often each source code line in each C or Python file has been
executed by the test suite.
