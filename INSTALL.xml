<section><h>Installation</h>
<p><app>distutils</app> is used for installation, so it's rather simple.
Execute the following command:</p>
<prog>
python setup.py install
</prog>

<p>For Windows a binary distribution is provided. To install it,
double click it and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><app>setuptools</app> is supported for installation, so if you have
<app>setuptools</app> installed the package will be installed as an egg
(and you can use <filename>easy_install</filename> for installation).</p>

<p>If you have difficulties installing this software, send a problem report
to Walter Dörwald (<email>walter@livinglogic.de</email>).</p>
</section>


<section><h>Configuration</h>
<p>In addition to the environment variables <lit>CC</lit> and <lit>CXX</lit>
(which are used by Python's Makefile itself for the C and C++ compiler), you
can set the environment variable <lit>COV</lit> to point to the coverage
program (the default is <lit>gcov</lit>).</p>

<p>You must create a directory <dirname>run</dirname> in your home directory,
where <mod>pycoco</mod> will put its pid file (log files will be put into
<dirname>~/log</dirname>, but this directory will be created automatically).</p>
